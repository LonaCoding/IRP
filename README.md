## Pipeline:

### I. Getting raw and meta data from NCBI GEO:
  1. GEO_datasetsSearch.ipnyb
  2. GEO_dataExtraction.ipnyb
  3. GEO_rawDataDownload.ipnyb

### II. Reading gene expression read files:

  4. reading_Affymetrix.R
  5. reading_NimbleGenIllumina.R

### III. Analyse data:

  6. analysis_differentialGE.R
  7. analysis_WCNA.R
  8. analysis_foldAndPathComparison.R
